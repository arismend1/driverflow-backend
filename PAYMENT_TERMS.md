# PAYMENT TERMS

**Last Updated**: January 20, 2026

## 1. CHARGE TRIGGERS
- **Event**: A financial obligation ("Ticket") is created exactly when authorized User (Company) clicks **"Approve"** on a Driver Application or Match.
- **Irrevocability**: Once approved, the Ticket is valid. You cannot "un-approve" to void fees to avoid payment.

## 2. PAYMENT & ACCESS
- **Pre-Payment Access**: Driver Contact Information remains **HIDDEN (LOCKED)** after Approval.
- **Unlock**: Access is granted only when the status of the associated Ticket changes to **PAID**.
- **Methods**: We accept major credit cards and ACH (for approved enterprise accounts only).

## 3. NON-PAYMENT CONSEQUENCES
- **Immediate Block**: Failure to pay a Ticket immediately (or within net terms if applicable) results in an automatic account freeze.
- **Service Suspension**: While **BLOCKED**:
    - You cannot see new Matches.
    - You cannot unlock pending Matches.
    - Your active Job Requests are hidden.

## 4. REFUNDS & DISPUTES
### 4.1 No Returns
We sell digital access. Since access cannot be "returned," **we do not offer refunds**.

### 4.2 Credit Notes
In rare cases of **Verified System Error** (e.g., you were charged twice for the same Driver ID), we may issue a **Credit Note**.
- Credit Notes are applied to future Matches.
- Credit Notes are not convertible to cash refunds.

### 4.3 Invalid Disputes
The following are NOT valid reasons for non-payment or dispute:
- "The driver didn't pick up the phone."
- "The driver wanted a higher salary than we offer."
- "We hired someone else."
- "We forgot we approved them."

## 5. TAXES
Prices are exclusive of applicable taxes. You are responsible for legally applicable taxes based on your jurisdiction.
