# PRIVACY POLICY

**Last Updated**: January 20, 2026

## 1. DATA COLLECTION
We collect:
- **Registration Data**: Name, Email, Phone, Company Details.
- **Match Data**: Interaction history, Match Approvals, Ticket generation.
- **Financial Data**: Processed securely via our payment provider (we do not store full card numbers).

## 2. THE "CONTACT REVEAL" MECHANISM
A core feature of DriverFlow is the conditional sharing of Personal Information.
- **Drivers**: Your Contact Information (Name, Phone, Email) is **HIDDEN** by default.
- **Companies**: You cannot view Driver Contact Information during the `SEARCH` or `MATCH` phase.

### 2.1 Trigger for Sharing
Driver Contact Information is shared with a Company ONLY when:
1.  **Mutual Interest**: A Match exists (`match_status: APPROVED`).
2.  **Obligation Met**: A specific Ticket is generated and its status becomes `PAID`.

Once these conditions are met, the System state transitions to `ACCESS_GRANTED`, and data is legally transferred.

## 3. DATA RETENTION
- We retain transaction records (Tickets) for tax and legal compliance (minimum 7 years).
- We retain Match history to prevent duplicate billing.

## 4. USER RIGHTS & DELETION
- **Right to Delete**: You may request deletion of your account.
- **Limitations**: We cannot delete Ticket records for completed transactions where service was rendered (i.e., Contact Information was already revealed to a commercial party).

## 5. SECURITY
We use industry-standard encryption. Access to "Locked" data is restricted at the database level and cleared only by verified payment events.
