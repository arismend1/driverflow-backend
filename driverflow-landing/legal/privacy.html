        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 20, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. DATA COLLECTION</h2>
        <p>We collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Registration Data:</strong> Name, Email, Phone, Company Details.</li>
            <li><strong>Match Data:</strong> Interaction history, Match Approvals, Ticket generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Processed securely via our payment provider (we do not store full card
                numbers).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. THE "CONTACT REVEAL" MECHANISM</h2>
        <p>A core feature of DriverFlow is the conditional sharing of Personal Information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Your Contact Information (Name, Phone, Email) is <strong>HIDDEN</strong> by
                default.</li>
            <li><strong>Companies:</strong> You cannot view Driver Contact Information during the SEARCH or MATCH phase.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Driver Contact Information is shared with a Company ONLY when Mutual Interest exists AND the Ticket is PAID.
        </p>

        <h2>3. DATA RETENTION</h2>
        <p>We retain transaction records (Tickets) for tax and legal compliance (minimum 7 years).</p>

        <h2>4. USER RIGHTS & DELETION</h2>
        <p>You may request deletion of your account. However, we cannot delete Ticket records for completed transactions
            where service was rendered (i.e., Contact Information was already revealed to a commercial party).</p>

        <h2>5. SECURITY</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard encryption. Access to "Locked" data is restricted at the database level and cleared
            only by verified payment events.</p>
