        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 20, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
        <p>By registering as a "Company" or "Driver" on the DriverFlow platform ("Service"), you agree to be bound by
            these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. SERVICE DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>DriverFlow is a marketplace connection platform.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Product:</strong> We sell <strong>Contact Access</strong> ("Matches").</li>
            <li><strong>Not an Employment Agency:</strong> We do not hire, screen for employment suitability, or employ
                drivers. We provide the technical ability to connect two interested parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Our obligation is fulfilled completely at the moment Driver contact information
                is revealed to the Company.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. ACCOUNT STATUS & ELIGIBILITY</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Company States</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>REGISTERED:</strong> You have created an account.</li>
            <li><strong>ACTIVE:</strong> You have verified credentials and may search for drivers.</li>
            <li><strong>BLOCKED:</strong> Your access is revoked due to non-payment or violation of terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. MATCHING & FEES</h2>
        <h3>4.1 The Match Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Companies view anonymous driver profiles (Experience, Location, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Request:</strong> Identifying information is hidden until a Match is confirmed and paid for.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Approval:</strong> When a Company selects "Approve" on a Driver application, a
                <strong>Ticket</strong> is strictly generated.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.2 Payment Obligation</h3>
        <p>Trigger: The payment obligation generally arises immediately upon Company Approval. Unlock: Driver contact
            details (Name, Phone, Email) are LOCKED until the specific Ticket associated with that match is PAID.</p>

        <h2>5. NO REFUNDS OR GUARANTEES</h2>
        <h3>5.1 No Hiring Guarantee</h3>
        <p>We do not guarantee that a Driver will answer your phone call, accept your job offer, or pass your internal
            background checks.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p><strong>ALL SALES ARE FINAL.</strong> DriverFlow does not issue refunds for "unsuccessful hires" or
            "unresponsive drivers". The fee pays for the connection, which is delivered instantly upon unlocking.</p>

        <h2>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DRIVERFLOW SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
            OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SPECIFIC MATCH
            GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>

        <h2>9. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
