## 2. SERVICE DESCRIPTION
DriverFlow is a marketplace connection platform.
- **The Product**: We sell **Contact Access** ("Matches").
- **Not an Employment Agency**: We do not hire, screen for employment suitability, or employ drivers. We provide the technical ability to connect two interested parties.
- **Scope**: Our obligation is fulfilled completely at the moment Driver contact information is revealed to the Company.

## 3. ACCOUNT STATUS & ELIGIBILITY
### 3.1 Company States
- **REGISTERED**: You have created an account.

- **BLOCKED**: Your access is revoked due to non-payment or violation of terms.
- **SEARCH_ON/OFF**: You control your visibility in the marketplace.

### 3.2 Driver States
- **ACTIVE**: Your profile is visible to companies.
- **SUSPENDED**: Your profile is hidden due to platform violations.

## 4. MATCHING & FEES
### 4.1 The Match Process
1.  **Discovery**: Companies view anonymous driver profiles (Experience, Location, etc.).
2.  **Request**: Identifying information is hidden until a Match is confirmed and paid for.
3.  **Approval**: When a Company selects "Approve" on a Driver application, a **Ticket** is strictly generated.

### 4.2 Payment Obligation

We do not guarantee that a Driver will:
- Answer your phone call.
- Accept your job offer.
- Pass your internal background checks.
- Remain employed for any duration.

### 5.2 Refund Policy
**ALL SALES ARE FINAL.**
DriverFlow does not issue refunds for "unsuccessful hires" or "unresponsive drivers". The fee pays for the *connection*, which is delivered instantly upon unlocking.

## 6. NON-PAYMENT & BLOCKING
### 6.1 Automatic Blocking
If a Ticket remains unpaid beyond the allowable window or if a payment fails:
