By registering and using the DriverFlow platform, the user (hereinafter referred to as the “COMPANY”) acknowledges that it has read, understood, and fully accepted these Terms and Conditions, which constitute a legally binding agreement between the COMPANY and Florida Luxury Services LLC, operating under the commercial brand “DriverFlow”.

If the COMPANY does not agree with these Terms, it must not register or use the platform.

1. NATURE OF THE SERVICE

DriverFlow is a digital intermediary platform whose sole purpose is to connect COMPANIES with independent drivers (“DRIVERS”).

Florida Luxury Services LLC / DriverFlow:
- does not provide transportation services;
- does not hire or employ drivers;
- does not guarantee services, results, or agreements;
- does not assume any responsibility for the relationship between the COMPANY and the DRIVER.

Any relationship, agreement, or service between the COMPANY and the DRIVER is direct, private, and entirely independent from DriverFlow and Florida Luxury Services LLC.

2. DEFINITION OF THE PRODUCT

The only product commercialized by DriverFlow is the validated access to contact information between a COMPANY and a DRIVER, once both parties voluntarily accept a request within the platform.

DriverFlow sells traffic and intermediary access only, not services, results, or contractual performance.

3. TICKET GENERATION AND DEBT CREATION

A “Ticket” is generated when:
- the COMPANY accepts a request;
- the DRIVER accepts the request; and
- DriverFlow releases the contact information between both parties.

The COMPANY expressly acknowledges and agrees that the debt is created immediately, automatically, and irrevocably at the moment the contact information between the COMPANY and the DRIVER is released.

The debt:
- does not depend on whether the DRIVER performs any service;
- does not depend on subsequent cancellations;
- does not depend on the outcome of any agreement between the parties.

The amount charged corresponds exclusively to the intermediary service provided by DriverFlow.

4. PRICING AND BILLING

Price per Ticket: USD 150 (one hundred fifty United States dollars).

Tickets are accumulated on a weekly basis.

Billing cycle: every Monday (Monday to Monday).

Payment due date: Friday of the same week.

Payment is made as a single weekly payment, not per individual Ticket.

All billing and collections are performed by Florida Luxury Services LLC.

5. NON-PAYMENT, TOLERANCE, AND ACCOUNT BLOCKING

A maximum tolerance of four (4) unpaid weekly billing cycles is granted.

During this period, the account may continue operating and payment reminders will be issued.

After four (4) unpaid weekly cycles, the COMPANY’s account will be automatically blocked from creating new requests.

Blocking does not eliminate or reduce the outstanding debt, which remains fully due and payable.

6. DISPUTES

The COMPANY may submit disputes regarding specific Tickets.

Disputes:
- do not suspend the overall service;
- do not stop billing;
- do not automatically cancel the debt.

Florida Luxury Services LLC reserves the exclusive right to resolve disputes administratively.

The COMPANY acknowledges that failure to pay constitutes a legally enforceable obligation.

Florida Luxury Services LLC may initiate legal collection actions, and the COMPANY shall be responsible for all legally permitted costs, interest, and expenses.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Neither DriverFlow nor Florida Luxury Services LLC shall be liable for:
- breaches between the COMPANY and the DRIVER;

- economic losses;
- accidents;
- labor, civil, or commercial disputes.

Use of the platform is at the COMPANY’s sole risk.
